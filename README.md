This is a project I created for FrontEndMentor and coded from scratch.

#Built with

-I built this project using React, React Router DOM, and Tailwind CSS.
-I normally would code mobile-first, but I decided to code desktop first then mobile later, since this was easier for me without worrying about the mobile. 
-I improved my flexbox skills.
-The only React hook I used was useState for opening and closing the mobile menu.
-Instead of using the icon images provided by FE Mentor, I used react-icons instead for the social media icons and close and open mobile menu icons.

#What I learned

-How to position background images
-How to center a fixed div (in this case, horizontally centering the fixed mobile menu in the middle of the viewport) using left: 0, right: 0, and margin: auto
-How to deploy React Router Dom V6 to Gh Pages by using HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter

#Continued development

-Optimize React and Tailwind code (write less cxode while achieving similar results)
-Read documentations more
-Learn Typescript or Next JS maybe
-Learn a React Component Library like Material UI or Chakra UI
-Learn more React hooks
